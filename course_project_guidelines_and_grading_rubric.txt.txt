(I) GRADING RUBRIC

The total score for project is 30%.

Here is the break down for the project report grading.

1. Choice of data mining task and/or questions investigated (6%)
 
2. Methodology to solve the data mining task and/or questions (8%)
 
3. Evaluation of the methodology for the task and/or to answer the identified questions (8%)
 
4. Quality of the written report. This includes figures and illustration of the various concepts/algorithms and also the experimental results. (8%)


(II) COURSE PROJECT REPORT WRITING GUIDELINES


Here are the guidelines for your report as promised. The project report should be written to address the grading criteria I shared with you earlier. (Ideally, you may want to write a project report that you can share with your recruiter when you apply for internships and full-time jobs at companies including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook etc. to improve your chances of getting hired)

The report will have roughly 7 sections. I will share some good examples from last year students soon.

1. Introduction

- Motivation from real-world applications for the data mining task you have chosen.

- Give some examples of data mining questions you set out to investigate in this project.

- State personal motivation to select this particular project and what were your goals. 

- Briefly describe the challenges and your approach to this task

- Briefly summarize your results.

2. Data Mining Task

- Clearly describe all the details of the task. What is the input data? What is the output of data mining approach? Give examples to illustrate them.

- List all the data mining questions that you set out to investigate in this project.

- List the key challenges to solve this task

3. Technical Approach

- Describe all the details of your algorithmic approach to solve this data mining task and/or answering the data mining questions.

- How are you addressing the challenges mentioned above

- An algorithmic pseudo-code and/or a figure (block diagram) to illustrate the approach will be good.

4. Evaluation Methodology

- Explain the dataset and its source that you employed to study this task. Any specific challenges to use this data for your task.

- List the metrics you employed to evaluate the output of data mining task and/or questions investigated. Justify their choice from real-world applications perspective.
 
5. Results and Discussion

- Present and explain results in a step-by-step manner to tell us a story about what you have discovered by doing this project (all graphs and tables should be properly labeled with legends and captions. they should be self-sufficient to understand the results)

- What worked and why?

- What didn't work and why not?

6. Lessons Learned

- What did you learn by doing this project? In the hindsight, would you have made some different decisions to improve the project further? 

7. Acknowledgements

- Acknowledge all the sources of help you got to do this project

(III) SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

The report is due on May 7th midnight. (I need time to grade and the final grades are due to Registrar by May 12. So I can't give you more time than this.)
